How much time do you spend in your text editor? We spend most of our time reading through text and jumping between files. My goal is to find a tool in order to help me do this more efficiently. I have found that learning Vim is not overwhelming or difficult if you break the units of work down into manageable pieces. The ultimate goal is to use Vim fulltime. Below are my curated steps:

##### Intro Video
* [Learning Vim in a Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NUO4JEtkDw)

##### Vimtutor
* Comprehensive introduction to Vim
* Type `vimtutor` in a Terminal session
* Complete a few sections per day

##### Screencasts
* [Derek Wyatt Novice](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/novice/)
* Watch one of these videos everyday

##### Advanced
* [Derek Wyatt Intermediate](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/intermediate/)
* [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2011/05/the-fugitive-series/), this series focuses on Vim-Fugitive, a GitHub plugin.

##### Helpful Links
* [Dotfiles](https://github.com/iacutone/dotfiles)
* Slowly build and customize your vimrc
* I find these plugins useful [Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) and [Vim Rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails)
