Purposefully, I began using Vim during a non-strenuous work week which helped manage frustration. I have been using solely Vim as a text editor for two weeks and have experienced improved efficienies over my previous text editor, Sublime.

##### Improvments
The ability to change between files quickly using the [Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin is the biggest quality of life increase. Commands such as `/` and `?` make finding word matches in a file easy. Using RSpec with Vim is also great; I can change my code and re-run a single test without switching screens! There are many small wins with using Vim and they add up.

##### Pain Points
Adding new files does not work if the directory does not exist. The [mkdir](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-mkdir) plugin solves this issue. Furthermore, commenting out code is a pain without [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary). Checking my vimrc file into version controller has been helpful in debgging where breaking changes originate.
