<p>The goal of this blog is to refine my writing skills. In order to fulfill this goal I will write about something interesting I learned on a weekly basis. I find that if I do not get into a routine, I will not fulfill my goal. So, every Friday after work I will post on this blog. I have no goals about the legth of posts, but to write something with clarity and thoughfulness.</p>
