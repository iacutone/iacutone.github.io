    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889">Udacity</a> Artificial Intelligence Nano Degree last month.</p>

<h3>Project 1, Sudoku Solver</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">This</a> post helpful for building a sudoku solver.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Sudoku Solver was a fun project. I enjoy learning by writing code to make tests pass, like Ruby Katas.</p>

<h3>Project 2, Isolation Game</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/ta-materials/apps/ab_tree_practice/">This</a> application is useful for visualizing alpha beta pruning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik">This</a> is a good introduction to the minimax function and alphabeta pruning.</li>
</ul>


<p>Creating an algo to play an Isolation Game is much more complicated than the first project and was very frustrating to build. Unlike the first project, there is barely a test framework to follow. You push your methods to a remote Udacity server which gives feedback about test failures. This development cycle is difficult to debug because you can neither use a debugger nor get <code>print</code> output.</p>

<p>Writing a synopsis for a research paper is also required for the project. I chose to write about <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf">AlphaGo</a>. I cannot understand the math proofs in the paper, so understanding the paper took several took several attempts.</p>
